# COPIKANA
[中文版本請至README_zh-Hant.md](https://github.com/samhui96/COPIKANA/edit/main/README_zh-Hant.md)

COPIKANA is a word converter based on [pykakasi](https://github.com/miurahr/pykakasi) for Japanese leaners, especially for those who are struggling with the pronunciation of kanji. It is a lightweight and offline app that minimise potential distractions.

Select the word you want to convert and then `right-click & copy` or simply press `Ctrl+C`, the most common pronunciation will be shown in the app. **Double click on the kanji to select** is recommended to include the suffix that is critical to decide the pronunciation. The converted result is the most common pronunciation in Japanese as there are too many possibilities for an offline app to decide. The below are the introduction of each version and their control widgets:

- **COPIKANA_1.0**: for those who are already familiar with hiragana.
  - Slider: adjust the font size

- **COPIKANA_1.1**: for those who need more hints other than hiragana. Two modes available: the hiragana mode, and the romaji mode which **does not support** the special pronunciations of ‘は’, ‘を’ and extended and rare kana.
  - Very short slider: switch between 'hiragana mode' and 'romaji mode'
  - Long slider: adjust the font size

- **COPIKANA_proj**: all the experiments are done here. Recently let you directly paste the convertion result by `right-click & paste` or  `Ctrl+V`, but funny things happen when you switch between the two modes.
  - Very short slider: switch between 'hiragana mode' and 'romaji mode'
  - Long slider: adjust the font size
  - Button with the character '文': change font

> This repo was inited much later after COPIKANA 1.0 is created, as I found Git/Github is harder than Python to learn 😅
> 
> If you try to pack COPIKANA into an EXE file, Microsoft Defender may think it is malware 😕 Exempt the folder where you are going to store the executable helps prevent the inconvenience. I'm working on the issue and hopefully it can be solved.
