# COPIKANA
COPIKANA is a word converter for Japanese leaners, especially for those who are struggling with the pronunciation of kanji. It is a lightweight and offline app that minimise potential distraction. Select the word you want to convert and then right-click to copy or simply press `ctrl+c`, the most common pronunciation will be shown in the app.

There are two modes available in version 1.1.0: the hiragana mode and the romaji mode. Double click to select kanji is recommended to include the suffix that is critical to decide the pronunciation. The romaji mode DOES NOT SUPPORT the special pronunciations of ‘は’, ‘を’ and extended and rare kana.
