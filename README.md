COPIKANA is a word converter built with [pykakasi](https://github.com/miurahr/pykakasi) designed for Japanese learners, especially those who find kanji pronunciation challenging. It is a lightweight offline app that helps minimise distractions while studying.

To convert a word, select it by either `right-click & copy` or simply press `Ctrl+C`. The app will display the most common pronunciation. **Double clicking on the kanji to select** is recommended to include suffixes that can affect pronunciation. Since kanji has many possible readings, the app provides the most common pronunciation for offline use. Below is an introduction to each version and its control widgets:

- **COPIKANA_1.0**: for those who are already familiar with hiragana.
  - Slider: adjust the font size

- **COPIKANA_1.1**: for those who need more hints other than hiragana. Two modes available: the hiragana mode, and the romaji mode which **does not support** the special pronunciations of ‘は’, ‘を’ and extended and rare kana.
  - Very short slider: switch between 'hiragana mode' and 'romaji mode'
  - Long slider: adjust the font size

- **COPIKANA_proj**: all the experiments are done here. Recently let you directly paste the convertion result by `right-click & paste` or  `Ctrl+V`, but funny things happen when you switch between the two modes.
  - Very short slider: switch between 'hiragana mode' and 'romaji mode'
  - Long slider: adjust the font size
  - Button with the character '文': change font
 
 ### If you you are happy to use, why not consider adding [the final touch](https://ko-fi.com/s/b8e4f06daa)? ✨

> This repo was inited much later after COPIKANA 1.0 is created, as I found Git/Github is harder than Python to learn 😅
> 
> If you try to pack COPIKANA into an EXE file, Microsoft Defender may think it is malware 😕 Exempt the folder where you are going to store the executable helps prevent the inconvenience. I'm working on the issue and hopefully it can be solved.
