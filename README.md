# COPIKANA
COPIKANA is a word converter based on [pykakasi](https://github.com/miurahr/pykakasi) for Japanese leaners, especially for those who are struggling with the pronunciation of kanji. It is a lightweight and offline app that minimise potential distractions.

Select the word you want to convert and then `right-click & copy` or simply press `Ctrl+C`, the most common pronunciation will be shown in the app. **Double click on the kanji to select** is recommended to include the suffix that is critical to decide the pronunciation.

*This repo was inited much later after COPIKANA 1.0 is created, as I found Git/Github is harder than Python to learn 😅

> **v1.0.0**: for those who are already familiar with hiragana.
> - Slider: adjust the font size

> **v1.1.0**: for those who need more hints other than hiragana. Two modes available: the hiragana mode, and the romaji mode which **does not support** the special pronunciations of ‘は’, ‘を’ and extended and rare kana.
> - Very short slider: switch between 'hiragana mode' and 'romaji mode'
> - Long slider: adjust the font size

>**COPIKANA_proj**: all the experiments are done here. Recently let you directly paste the convertion result by `right-click & paste` or  `Ctrl+V`, but funny things happen when you switch between the two modes.
