# COPIKANA
COPIKANA is a word converter for Japanese leaners, especially for those who are struggling with the pronunciation of kanji. It is a lightweight and offline app that minimise potential distraction.

Select the word you want to convert and then right-click to copy or simply press `Ctrl+C`, the most common pronunciation will be shown in the app. **Double click on the kanji to select** is recommended to include the suffix that is critical to decide the pronunciation.
