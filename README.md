# COPIKANA
COPIKANA is a word converter for Japanese leaners, especially for those who are struggling with the pronunciation of kanji. It is a lightweight and offline app that minimise potential distraction.

Select the word you want to convert and then right-click to copy or simply press `Ctrl+C`, the most common pronunciation will be shown in the app. **Double click on the kanji to select** is recommended to include the suffix that is critical to decide the pronunciation.

- Version 1.0.0: for those who are already familiar with hiragana. There is a slider for adjusting the font size.
- Version 1.1.0: for those who need more hints other than hiragana. There are two modes available: the hiragana mode and the romaji mode. The romaji mode **does not support** the special pronunciations of ‘は’, ‘を’ and extended and rare kana.
