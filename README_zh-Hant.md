> This repo was inited much later after COPIKANA 1.0 is created, as I found Git/Github is harder than Python to learn üòÖ
> 
> If you try to pack COPIKANA into an EXE file, Microsoft Defender may think it is malware üòï Exempt the folder where you are going to store the executable helps prevent the inconvenience. I'm working on the issue and hopefully it can be solved.

- **v1.0.0**: for those who are already familiar with hiragana.
  - Slider: adjust the font size

- **v1.1.0**: for those who need more hints other than hiragana. Two modes available: the hiragana mode, and the romaji mode which **does not support** the special pronunciations of ‚Äò„ÅØ‚Äô, ‚Äò„Çí‚Äô and extended and rare kana.
  - Very short slider: switch between 'hiragana mode' and 'romaji mode'
  - Long slider: adjust the font size

- **COPIKANA_proj**: all the experiments are done here. Recently let you directly paste the convertion result by `right-click & paste` or  `Ctrl+V`, but funny things happen when you switch between the two modes.
  - Very short slider: switch between 'hiragana mode' and 'romaji mode'
  - Long slider: adjust the font size
  - Button with the character 'Êñá': change font
